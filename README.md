# xnu_macho_loader
I needed this for another project, so it is not in any usable state. Don't expect it to work out of the box. Key kernel functions are replaced with userspace "equivalents" such as mmap. The useful part is that this code is self contained for userspace compilation in case you need the loader for whatever reason.
